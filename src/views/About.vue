Visual design has proven to be one of my greatest assets as a Web Developer. I\'m an artist at heart and with my creative mind, I can approach a problem from many different angles. I\'ve also worked closely with stake holders on the UX Design front where I enjoy increased personal interaction focused on business strategies.',
